# Sample BDD Project

A simple demonstration of a Java (Maven) project which uses Cucumber to run
BDD tests against the Makers website (via Selenium).

This project was constructed via the following steps:

* Create a folder for the project.
* Ensure you have Maven installed (`brew install mvn`).
* Follow the [10 Minute 
Tutorial](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/10-minute-tutorial/?lang=java) on the 
Cucumber website, until you can demonstrate that running `mvn test` shows a
"Tests completed" message.
* Follow the [Browser 
Automation](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/browser-automation/?lang=java) page 
on the Cucumber website, to incorporate sample Selenium code into your step
definitions.
* Add a `cucumber.properties` file to the `src/test/resources` folder, which is 
configured to enable the automatic exporting of test reports.
